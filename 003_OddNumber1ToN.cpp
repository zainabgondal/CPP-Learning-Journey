//	Ques: Display this AP (Arithmetic progression) - 1,3,5,7,9....upto 'n' terms.
//   we will solve this by two methods
//   1. easy math
//   2. without math
//like 1,5,9,13,?    sol: 4 difference between each word so 13+4=17 will be the ans.
//  1.By math method
//nth term formula  a = a + (n-1) d
//          a is 1st term,n is no of terms,d is difference
// in this problem a is 1,n is n and d is 2 bec 1,3 has 2 no differance and all as same
//      a = 1(n-1)2
//      a = 2n-1 the condition we will put in our program
